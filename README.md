#Instructions
1. Make sure only one instance of the main file is open.
2. On the main file, open the console and open a controller file in a separate browser instance.
3. You should see a message on the main file indicating that a player has joined. 
4. You can now use 'WASD' on the controller file to move one of three sprites on the screen.
5. Up to 3 players can move sprites at once, any more that join will not be able to move anything. 
6. Make sure that you press the 'unsubscribe' button before closing your controller file.
